## Required Packages

- dplyr was used to manipulate the data
- ggplo2 was used to create figures 
- tidyr was not used since the data was already arranged to desired standards

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## What is a Mantis Shrimp?

![](../figures/mantis_pic.jpg)

- Mantis shrimps or stomatopods
- Marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda 
- Some species have blunt forelimbs while others have sharp ones

## External Anatomy

![](../figures/anatomy.jpg)

- Appendages
- Telson

## Telson Sparring

![](../figures/sparring.gif)

- During telson sparring, mantis shrimp take turns striking with their appendages against the telson of their opponent
- Individuals direct nearly every strike to the telson, and this is facilitated by the recipient assuming a coiled position referred to as a ‘telson coil’

## Data used

```{r}
data_1 <- read.csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/16851587")
knitr::kable(data_1)

```

## What does this data describe? (Prose)

![Mantis Shrimp Shells](../figures/shells.gif)

- Many types of animals develop morphological traits to partake in ritualized combat.
- Mantis shrimp present an interesting case in which their unique form of ritualized combat, termed telson sparring, may have coevolved with specialized morphological armour.

## What is COR?

- The coefficient of restitution (COR), also denoted by (e), is the ratio of the final to initial relative velocity between two objects after they collide

- can also be viewed in terms of kinetic energy before and after a collision. 

- e is usually a positive number between 0 and 1:

- e = 0: This is a perfectly inelastic collision. Kinetic energy is dissipated (converted to heat or work). 

- 0 < e < 1: This is a real-world inelastic collision, in which some kinetic energy is dissipated.

- e = 1: This is a perfectly elastic collision, in which no kinetic energy is dissipated, and the objects rebound from one another with the same initial velocity.


## Data Manipulation

- separated species with "smasher" and "spearer" appendages by using filter()
- Wanted to see if there were different trends between appendage types

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

smasher_data <- data_1 %>%
  group_by(appendage) %>%
  filter(appendage == "smasher") 

spearer_data <- data_1 %>%
  group_by(appendage) %>%
  filter(appendage != "smasher")

```

## Linear Model Function
``` {r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

lm_1 <- lm(cor.telson~cor.abdomen, data_1) #linear model function 
summary(lm_1)[[9]] #number assocaited with chunk, returns r squared value

results <- summary(lm_1) 
results$coefficients[8] #returns p value

```


## Figure 1 - Plot of all appendage types {.smaller}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
lm_1 <- lm(cor.telson~cor.abdomen, data_1) #linear model function 
summary(lm_1)[[9]] #number assocaited with chunk, returns r squared value

results <- summary(lm_1) 
results$coefficients[8] #returns p value

ggplot(data_1, aes(x=cor.abdomen,y=cor.telson))+
  geom_point(shape=1)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)

ggsave("../figures/all_data.jpg")

```

## Figure 2 - Plot of smashers {.smaller}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
lm_2 <- lm(cor.telson~cor.abdomen, smasher_data) #linear model function 
summary(lm_2)[[9]] #number assocaited with chunk, returns r squared value

results_2 <- summary(lm_2) 
results_2$coefficients[8] #returns p value

ggplot(smasher_data, aes(x=cor.abdomen,y=cor.telson))+
  geom_point(shape=1)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)

ggsave("../figures/smasher_data.jpg")

```

## Figure 3 - Plot of spearers {.smaller}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
lm_3 <- lm(cor.telson~cor.abdomen, spearer_data) #linear model function 
summary(lm_3)[[9]] #number assocaited with chunk, returns r squared value

results_3 <- summary(lm_3) 
results_3$coefficients[8] #returns p value

ggplot(spearer_data, aes(x=cor.abdomen,y=cor.telson))+
  geom_point(shape=1)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)

ggsave("../figures/spearer_data.jpg")
  
```
